This is just one of the resources to get to know Github but there are lots more guides if you like: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
I recommend using GitHub for Windows to copy these files to your PC and then work on them on your personal co-project.
If you need to know anything about how to edit and files or view the database all the info should be on learn.
